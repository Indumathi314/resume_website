                <strong>SDP Internship | GITAM UNIVERSITY</strong>
                <p>I completed a 6-week hands-on internship, gaining practical experience in electronics and digital design. During the internship, I created digital resumes, designed PCBs, and worked on VLSI projects using FPGA and Cadence tools. One key project involved designing a vending machine system with an FPGA kit, which enhanced my FPGA development skills. This internship provided valuable insights into both hardware and digital system design. It was a significant step in building my expertise in these areas.</p>
